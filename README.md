I noticed that the search engine of the ad portal does not include the rent to the total rental price. For example, I have a budget of 2,500 PLN for an apartment. I enter this amount in the search engine and an apartment pops up for 2300 PLN, summarising, I enter the ad and the rent is an additional 700 PLN. This application takes into account the rent and will not show this apartment in the search up to 2500PLN.
